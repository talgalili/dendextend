dendextend 0.15.0 (2014-07-06)
----------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS:
   * dendlist - a function which creates a list of dendrogram of the new "dendlist" class.
      * tanglegram.dendlist
      * entanglement.dendlist
      * is.dendlist - to check that an object is a dendlist
      * as.dendlist - to turn a list to a dendlist
   * click_rotate - interactively rotate a tree (thanks to Andrej-Nikolai Spiess)
   * untangle - a master function to control all untangle functions (making it much easier to navigate this feature, as well as use it through %>% piping)

UPDATED R FUNCTIONS:
   * Made sure that the main untangle functions will return a dendlist (and also that untangle_step_rotate_2side will be able to work with the new untangle_step_rotate_1side output)

NEW S3 METHODS:
   * tanglegram.dendlist

NEW FILES
   * dendlist.R
   * test-dendlist.R

UPDATED TESTS: 
   * Check dendlist works

OTHER NOTES:
   * DESCRIPTION - 
      * Added the magrittr package as a Depends.
      * changed stats from depends to imports. Here is a good reference for why to choose the one over the other - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8637993/better-explanation-of-when-to-use-imports-depends
And: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6895852/load-a-package-only-when-needed-in-r-package

dendextend 0.14.4 (2014-07-04)
----------------------------

OTHER NOTES:
   * Changed all R script files from .r to .R!


dendextend 0.14.3 (2014-04-26)
----------------------------
UPDATED DESCRIPTION:
   * Fix an author name.
   * Added dendextendRcpp to suggest

OTHER NOTES:
   * Minor changes to docs.

dendextend 0.14.2 (2014-03-15)
----------------------------

UPDATED DESCRIPTION:
   * Added dependency for R (>= 3.0.0)

OTHER NOTES:
   * dendextend 0.14.2 is intended to be shipped to CRAN.



dendextend 0.14.1 (2014-03-15)
----------------------------

UPDATED DESCRIPTION:
   * Added Uwe and Kurt as contributors.
   * Removed Suggests: dendextendRcpp, (until it would be on CRAN)
   * Removed link to google group


NEW FUNCTIONS:
   * dendextend_options (actually an enviornment + a function). Here I've moved the dendextend_options from the global enviornment to the dendextend namespace.

UPDATED TESTS: 
   * update test_rotate.r so it would make sure ape is loaded BEFORE dendextend.

OTHER NOTES:
   * dendextend 0.14.1 goes with Version 0.5.0 of dendextendRcpp. Previous versions of dendextendRcpp will not be effective for versions of dendextend which are before 0.14.0.
   * dendextend 0.14.1 is intended to be shipped to CRAN.



dendextend 0.14.0 (2014-03-15)
----------------------------


UPDATED R FUNCTIONS:
   * assign_dendextend_options - Moved to passing the functions through "dendextend_options" instead of through "options" (Thanks to suggestions by Kurt Hornik and Uwe Ligges).
   * assign_dendextend_options - is now exported.
   * remove_dendextend_options - now removes the object dendextend_options
   * get_branches_heights, heights_per_k.dendrogram, cut_lower_fun - now all rely on dendextend_options.

UPDATED TESTS: 
   * update tests to the new names in dendextendRcpp (dendextendRcpp_cut_lower_fun, dendextend_options)


dendextend 0.13.0 (2014-03-01)
----------------------------

UPDATED R FUNCTIONS:
   * assign_dendextend_options - Moved to passing the functions through "options" instead of through assignInNamespace (which was not intended for production use).
   * get_branches_heights, heights_per_k.dendrogram, cut_lower_fun - now all rely on the function located in the global options. This way, they can be replaced by the dendextebdRcpp version, if available.

UPDATED TESTS: 
   * When comparing to dendextendRcpp - added condition to not make the check if the package is not loaded and in the search path (this way I could compare the tests with and without the dendextendRcpp package).
   * added a minor test for dendextend_get_branches_heights - checking the function directly through the options.

UPDATED DOCS: 
   * dendextend_get_branches_heights, dendextend_heights_per_k.dendrogram, dendextend_cut_lower_fun - gave speed tests



NEW FUNCTIONS:
   * assign_dendextend_options - we now pass all functions that have a Rcpp equivalent through "options". While this adds a bit of an overhead (sadly), it still gets a much faster speed gain, and without verious warnings that CRAN checks would not like...
   * dendextend_get_branches_heights, dendextend_heights_per_k.dendrogram, dendextend_cut_lower_fun

OTHER NOTES:
   * dendextend 0.13.0 goes with Version 0.4.0 of dendextendRcpp. Previous versions of dendextendRcpp will not be effective for versions of dendextend which are before 0.13.0 (however, it would also not conflict with them...)
   * dendextend 0.13.0 is intended to be shipped to CRAN.



dendextend 0.12.2 (2014-02-03)
----------------------------
UPDATED DESCRIPTION:
   * Removed VignetteBuilder: knitr (until later)
   * Removed Suggests: dendextendRcpp, (until later)
   * fixed mis-spelled words: extanding (14:40)

NEW FUNCTIONS:
   * Hidden "stats" functions have been added to a new file "imports_stats.r"
      with a new local copy for
                           'stats:::.memberDend' 'stats:::.midDend'
                           'stats:::midcache.dendrogram' 'stats:::plotNode'
                           'stats:::plotNodeLimit'
      with stats::: -> stats_

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * stats:::cutree -> stats::cutree
   * dendextend:::cutree -> dendextend::cutree

OTHER NOTES:
   * compacted ‘dendextend-tutorial.pdf’ from 961Kb to 737Kb (thanks to tools::compactPDF)
   * dendextend 0.12.2 is intended to be shipped to CRAN.



dendextend 0.12.1 (2014-02-02)
----------------------------

UPDATED TESTS: 
   * Made sure to check dendextendRcpp is available before calling it.

UPDATED DOCS:
   * data(iris) -> data(iris, envir = environment()) 
   * Fix "\examples lines wider than 100 characters:" in several places.

OTHER NOTES:
   * Commented out manipulations on the search path and of assignInNamespace (to avoid NOTES/warnings). This was done after moving all of these operations into Rcpp.
   * dendextend 0.12.1 is intended to be shipped to CRAN. (but failed)

dendextend 0.12.0 (2014-02-01)
----------------------------

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * exported prune_leaf
   * as.dendrogram.phylo as.phylo.dendrogram - turned into S3 (no longer exported)
   * changed functions names:
      * trim -> prune
      * unroot -> unbranch
   * Moved from ::: to :: (where possible).
   * tanglegram.dendrogram - fix warning in layout(matrix(1:3, nrow = 1), width =
  columns_width): partial argument match of 'width' to 'widths'
   * Return "as.phylo.dendrogram" by adding "ape" to "Imports" in DESCRIPTION and "import" to NAMESPACE. Also fixing consistancy (using x instead of object).
   * unbranch.phylo - fix extra parameters.

UPDATED DOCS:
   * leaf_Colors - fix example (added "dend").
   * Fix various "Missing link or links in documentation object" for example:
      * remove \link{untangle} from various .Rd (I never created this function...)
      * tangelgram -> tanglegram
   * fix "Unknown package 'dendroextra' in Rd xrefs" in color_branches docs. (into dendroextras)
   * Fix Undocumented code objects: 'old_cut_lower_fun' 'old_get_branches_heights'
  'old_heights_per_k.dendrogram'.  By adding them as "#' @aliases"
   * Fix "Codoc mismatches from documentation object"
      * 'rotate': - by removing k and h (since I never got to implement them...)
      * 
   * Fix "Mismatches in argument default values"
      * tanglegram
          * Name: 'margin_inner' Code: 3 Docs: 1.8
          * Name: 'lab.cex' Code: NULL Docs: 1
          * Name: 'remove_nodePar' Code: FALSE Docs: F
   * Fix "Argument names in code not in docs", for: edge.lwd dLeaf_left dLeaf_right main sub rank_branches hang match_order_by_labels cex_main cex_main_left cex_main_right cex_sub
   * Fix "'library' or 'require' call not declared from: 'ape'" by commenting-off every "require(ape)" command in the code, since it is already mentioned in imports!
      (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15648772/how-do-i-prevent-r-library-or-require-calls-not-declared-warnings-when-dev)
      The problem still persists because of .onLoad in zzz.r, but we'll look into this later...
   * Fix "Undocumented arguments in documentation object" for:
      * 'bakers_gamma_for_2_k_matrix'
      * 'cor_bakers_gamma'
      * 'cut_lower_fun'
   * Fix "Objects in \usage without \alias in documentation object 'shuffle'":
  'shuffle.dendrogram' 'shuffle.hclust' 'shuffle.phylo'
   * Fix "Argument items with no description in Rd object": 'plot_horiz.dendrogram', 'untangle_step_rotate_1side'.
   * rotate - Remove the "flip" command in the example (after I noticed that "rev" does this just fine...)


UPDATED TESTS: 
   * S3methods no longer seem to be exported (due to something in roxygen2), I chose to update the tests accordingly.
      * cutree.hclust -> dendextend:::cutree.hclust
      * cutree.dendrogram -> dendextend:::cutree.dendrogram
   * cut_lower_fun acts diffirently on dendextendRcpp vs old dendextend, so I updated the tests to reflect that.
   * Fixed the usage of person() in DESCRIPTION. (props goes to Uwe Ligges for his input)

OTHER NOTES:
   * Fixing .Rd indentation.
   * Fix S3method in NAMESPACE.
   * Added "ape::" to as.phylo.
   * Added to .Rbuildignore: (large files which are not essential)
      * inst/doc/2013-09-05_Boston-useR
      * vignettes/figure
      * vignettes/ (we'll deal with this later...)
   * Removed "Enhances: ape" from DESCRIPTION
   * README.md - Using 'talgalili/dendextend', in install_github




dendextend 0.11.2 (2013-08-31)
----------------------------

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * tanglegram now has "sub" and "cex_sub" parameters.
   * untangle_step_rotate_2side added k_seq parameter.
   * "trim" is now called "prune"!

VIGNETTES:
   * Finished tanglegram and untangle. 
   * Finished statistical measures of similarity between trees. 


dendextend 0.11.1 (2013-08-29)
----------------------------
UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * color_labels - added a "warn" parameter. And also set the default (in case no k/h is supplied) - to just color all of the labels.
   * Added "warn" parameter to: assign_values_to_leaves_nodePar, And set it to FALSE when used inside "tanglegram".
   * tanglegram now returns an invisible list with the two dendrograms (after they have been modified within the function).

BUG FIXES:
   * untangle_random_search - made sure the function will return the original trees if no better tree was found.

OTHER NOTES:
   * Seperated 2013-09-05_Boston-useR.Rpres into two files (since RStudio is not able to handle them)

dendextend 0.11.0 (2013-08-24)
----------------------------
VIGNETTES:
   * Added a knitr presentation for "Boston-useR" 2013-09-05. Includes an introduction to hclust and dendrogram objects, tree manipulation, and dendextend modules (still needs the dendextend section on tanglegram...)

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * tanglegram - added cex_main parameter.


OTHER NOTES:
   * Gave proper credit to contributers in the DESCRIPTION file (and not just the .Rd files)

dendextend 0.10.0 (2013-08-20)
----------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * cut_lower_fun - it wraps the "cut" function, and is built to be masked by the function in dendextendRcpp in order to gain 4-14 speed gain.

NEW TESTS ADDED: 
   * For Bk methods.

OTHER NOTES:
   * The dendextendRcpp package (version 0.3.0) is now on github, and offers functions for making cutree.dendrogram(h) faster (between 4 to 14 times faster).

VIGNETTES:
   * Added cut_lower_fun to the Rcpp section.
   * Added FM-index and Bk plot sections.



dendextend 0.9.2 (2013-08-20)
----------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * cor_bakers_gamma.hclust

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * cutree.hclust - added the "use_labels_not_values" paremter (ignored)



dendextend 0.9.1 (2013-08-19)
----------------------------
UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * color_labels - added "labels" parameter for selective coloring of labels by name.
   * Bk_plot - now adds dots for the asymptotic lines in case of NA's   
   * Bk - now calculates cutree once for all relevant k's - and only then goes forth with FM_index.

BUG FIXES: 
   * FM_index_R - now returns NA when comparing NA vectors (when, for example, there is no possible split for some k), instead of crashing (as it did before).
   * Bk_plot - now won't turn one dendrogram into hclust, while leaving the other a dendrogram.

OTHER NOTES:
   * The dendextendRcpp package (version 0.2.0) is now on github, and offers functions for making cutree.dendrogram(k) MUCH faster (between 20 to 100 times faster). (this is besided having labels.dendrogram now also accept a leaf as a tree.)

VIGNETTES:
   * Added Rcpp section.
   * Started the Bk section (some theory, but no code yet - although it is all written by now...).


dendextend 0.9.0 (2013-08-18)
----------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * sort_2_clusters_vectors
   * FM_index_profdpm 
   * FM_index_R
   * FM_index
   * FM_index_permutation - for checking permutation distribution of the FM Index
   * Bk
   * Bk_permutations
   * Bk_plot (it can be MUCH slower for dendrograms with large trees, but works great for hclust)

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * color_labels - removed unused 'groupLabels' parameter.

VIGNETTES:
   * Added the FM Index section.

FILE CHANGES:
   * Bk-method.r file added.

OTHER NOTES:
   * The dendextendRcpp package (version 0.1.1) is now on github, and offers a faster labels.dendrogram function (It is 20 to 40 times faster than the 'stats' function!)
   * Added a commented-out section which could (in the future) be the basis of an Rcpp cutree (actually cutree_1h.dendrogram) function!


dendextend 0.8.0 (2013-08-14)
----------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * cor_bakers_gamma
   * sample.dendrogram
   * rank_order.dendrogram - for fixing leaves value order.
   * duplicate_leaf - for sample.dendrogram
   * sample.dendrogram - for bootstraping trees when the original data table is missing.

   * sort_dist_mat
   * cor_cophenetic

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * tanglegram - added the match_order_by_labels parameter.

VIGNETTES:
   * Added the Baker's Gamma Index section.
   * Added a bootstrap and permutation examples for inference on Baker's Gamma.
   * Also for Cophenetic correlation.

FILE CHANGES:
   * sample.dendrogram.r file added.

BUG FIXES: 
   * fix_members_attr.dendrogram - fixed a bug introduced by the new "members" method in nleaves. (test added)

dendextend 0.7.3 (2013-08-14)
----------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * get_childrens_heights - Get height attributes from a dendrogram's children
   * rank_branches - ranks the heights of branches - making comparison of the topologies of two trees easier.

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * sort_levels_values - now returns a vector with NA's as is without changing it. Also, a warning is issued (with a parameter to supress the warning called 'warn')
   * cutree - now supresses warnings produced by sort_levels_values, in the case of NA values.
   * plotNode_horiz now uses "Recall" (I might implement this in more function).
   * tanglegram - added parameters hang and rank_branches.

BUG FIXES: 
   * tanglegram - fixed the right tree's labels position relative to the leaves tips. (they were too far away because of a combination of text_adj with dLeaf)

VIGNETTES:
   * Fixed the dLeaf in tanglegram plots, and gave an example of using rank_branches. 


dendextend 0.7.2 (2013-08-13)
----------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * plotNode_horiz - allows the labels, in plot_horiz.dendrogram, to be aligned to the leaves tips when the tree is plotted horizontally, its leaves facing left.

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * plot_horiz.dendrogram - allows the labels to be aligned to the leaves tips when the tree is plotted horizontally, its leaves facing left. (took a lot of digging into internal functions used by plot.dendrogram)
   * tanglegram - added the parameters: dLeaf_left dLeaf_right. Also, labels are now alligned to the leaves tips in the right dendrogram.

BUG FIXES: 
   * Fix untangle_step_rotate_1side to work with non-missing dend_heights_per_k
   * Set sort_cluster_numbers = TRUE for cutree, in order to make it compatible with stats::cutree. Added a test for this.
   * Fix cutree.hclust to work with a vector of k when !order_clusters_as_data
   * Fix cutree.dendrogram to give default results as stats::hclust does, by setting the default to sort_cluster_numbers = TRUE.

OTHER NOTES:
   * Variations of the changes to plot_horiz.dendrogram and plotNode_horiz should be added to R core in order to allow forward compatability.


dendextend 0.7.1 (2013-08-12)
----------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * untangle_step_rotate_2side

NEW VIGNETTES SECTIONS ADDED:

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * assign_values_to_leaves_nodePar - now makes sure pch==NA if we are modifying a nodePar value which is other than pch (and pch did not exist before).
   * nleaves - now allow the use of the "members" attr of a dendrogram for telling us the size of the tree.

OTHER NOTES:
   * entanglement.r file added
   * untangle.r file added

NEW VIGNETTES SECTIONS ADDED:

dendextend 0.4 (2013-08-02) 
---------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
(including tests and documentation)
   * is.natural.number
   * cutree_1h.dendrogram - like cutree, but only for 1 height value.
   * fix_members_attr.dendrogram - just to validate that prune works o.k.
   * hang.dendrogram - hangs a dendrogram leaves (also allows for a rotated hanged dendrogram), works also for non-binary trees.
   * nnodes - count the number of nodes in a tree
   * as.dendrogram.phylo - based on as.hclust.
   * get_nodes_attr - allows easy access to attributes of branches and leaves
   * get_branches_heights
   * fix_members_attr.dendrogram
   * heights_per_k.dendrogram - get the heights for a tree that will yield each k cluster.
   * is.hclust
   * is.dendrogram
   * is.phylo
   * fac2num
   * as.phylo.dendrogram - based on as.hclust.
   
   * cutree_1k.dendrogram - like cutree, but only for 1 k (number of clusters) value.
   * cutree.dendrogram - like cutree but for dendrograms (and it is also vectorized)
   * cutree.hclust - like cutree but for hclust
   * cutree.phylo - like cutree but for phylo
   * sort_levels_values - make the resulting clusters from cutree to be ordered from left to right
   * cutree - with S3 methods for dendrogram/hclust/phylo

   * color_branches - color a tree branches based on its clusters. This is a modified version of the color_clusters function from jefferis's dendroextra package. It extends it by using my own version of cutree.dendrogram - allowing the function to work for trees that hclust can not handle (unrooted and non-ultrametric trees). Also, it allows REPEATED cluster color assignments to branches on to the same tree. Something which the original function was not able to handle. It also handles extreme cases, such as when the labels of a tree are integers.
   * color_labels - just like color_branches, but for labels.
   
   * assign_values_to_leaves_nodePar - allows for complex manipulation of dendrogram's leaves parameters.

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * nleaves - added nleaves.phylo methods, based on as.hclust so it could be improved in the future.
   * "labels_colors<-" - fixed it so that by default it would not add phc=1 to the leaves.
   * "order.dendrogram<-" - now returns an integer (instead of numeric)
   * cutree (cutree.dendogram / cutree.hclust) - Prevent R from crashing when using 
cutree on a subset tree (e.g: dend[[1]])
   * Renaming the unroot function -> to -> unbranch 
   * get_leaves_attr - added a simplify parameter.

OTHER NOTES:
   * Updated the exact way the GPL was stated in DESCRIPTION and gave a better reference within each file.

NEW VIGNETTES SECTIONS ADDED:
   * Hanging trees
   * Coloring branches.
   

dendextend 0.3 (2013-07-27) 
---------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * removed "flip", added rev.hclust instead (since rev.dendrogram already exists)

NEW VIGNETTES SECTIONS ADDED:
   * Vignettes created (using LaTeX)
   * Basic introduction to dendrogram objects
   * Labels extraction and assignment, and measuring tree size.
   * Tree manipulation: unrooting, pruning, label coloring, rotation

NEW TESTS ADDED:
   * labels extraction, assignment and tree size (especially important for comparing hclust and dendrogram!)
   * Tree manipulation: unrooting, pruning, label coloring, rotation

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * "labels.hclust" - added the "order" parameter. (based on some ideas from Gregory Jefferis's dendroextras package)
   * "labels.hclust" and "labels.hclust<-" - now both use order=TRUE as default. this makes them consistent with labels.dendrogram. Proper tests have been implemented.
   * "labels<-.dendrogram" - make sure the new dendrogram does not have each of its node of class "dendrogram" (which happens when using dendrapply)
   * unclass_dend - now uses dendrapply
   * get_branches_attr - added "warning" parameter
   * unroot.dendrogram - Can now deal with unrooting more than 3 branches. supresses various warnings. 
   * as_hclust_fixed - now works just as as.hclust when hc is missing.
   * rotate - allowed "order" to accept character vector.

OTHER NOTES:
   * Extending the documentation for: rotate, labels.hclust,
   * Added a welcome massage to when loading the package (zzz.r file added)
   * Added a first template for browseVignettes(package ='dendextend')
   * Added a tests folder - making the foundation for using testthat.
      * Added tests for labels assignment
   * Added a clear GPL-2+ copyright notice on each r file.
	* Forcing {ape} to load before {dendextend}, thus allowing for both rotate and unroot to work for BOTH packages. It does add extra noise when loading the package, but it is the best solution I can think of at this point.


dendextend 0.2 (2013-04-10) 
---------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * count_terminal_nodes
   * labels_colors (retrieving and assignment)

OTHER NOTES:
   * From here on I will be using "." only for S3 method functions.  Other functions will use "_"
   * Added more .r files, and changed the locations of some functions.

   * add a print/warn parameter to intersect_trees
   * add rect.hclust.nice http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4720307/change-dendrogram-leaves 
   * Give this a thought: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10088117/exporting-dendrogram-as-table-in-r?rq=1
   * reply here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10571266/colouring-branches-in-a-dendrogram-in-r?rq=1
   * create rect.dendrogram (and make rect generic). http://stackoverflow.com/questions/717747/how-do-i-color-edges-or-draw-rects-correctly-in-an-r-dendrogram

   * hide some function's doc (labels<-.stuff)
   * cite agnes/cluster and http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/cluster.pdf
   Maybe also spantree {vegan}
   * boot_dend - create a same-size tree, while sampling (with repetition) the leaves! # later for boot
   * An algorithm to find subtrees that are topologically identical between the two trees - and color them accordingly.
   * Get stats::midcache.dendrogram to work for non-binary trees...
   * cut_replace - make it in Rcpp - to make cutree_1h.dendrogram faster...
   * See this code: https://github.com/andrie/ggdendro/blob/master/R/dendro_rpart.R
   for creating an rpart plotting machanism using dendrograms!
   This will enable hilighting one branch/rule.
   Note that more "attr" will need to be added to the tree in order to
   include all of the rpart information. This could also allow the merging of plots from rpart/party etc. 
   
   * Add as.dendrogram.ctree . Example code for further work:
require(party)
set.seed(290875)
### regression
airq <- subset(airquality, !is.na(Ozone))
airct <- ctree(Ozone ~ ., data = airq, 
                   controls = ctree_control(maxsurrogate = 3))
airct
plot(airct)
str(airct@tree)
# as.dendrogram.ctree will need to work with the above object
# to extract the elements needed for detecting the tree's parameters...

	* Create: as.dendrogram.randomForest (a template is available in the R folder)	
	* Check if I need to implement something from here: http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/dendrogram-plot-does-not-draw-long-labels-td3235843.html
	* Also good: get the conditions in a tree: http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/41443/how-to-actually-plot-a-sample-tree-from-randomforestgettree
	* Look into the proximity matrix produced from a randomForest:
data(iris)
require(randomForest)
mod.rf <- randomForest(Species ~ ., data=iris,  proximity=TRUE)
hc <- hclust(as.dist(mod.rf$proximity))
plot(as.dendrogram(hc))
MDSplot(mod.rf, iris$Species)
	
	* Combine with gridBase to include sub plots like in {party: ?plot.BinaryTree}
