#'
#' Khan contains gene expression profiles of four types of small round

#' @format
#'
#' Khan is dataset containing the following:
#'    \describe{
#'       \item{train:}{\code{\link{data.frame}} of 306 rows and 64 columns.
#'          The training dataset of 64 arrays and 306 gene expression values}
#'       \item{test:}{\code{\link{data.frame}}, of 306 rows and 25 columns.
#'          The test dataset of 25 arrays and 306 genes expression values}
#'       \item{gene.labels.imagesID:}{\code{vector} of 306 Image clone identifiers
#'          corresponding to the rownames of train and test.}
#'       \item{train.classes:}{\code{\link{factor}} with 4 levels "EWS",
#'          "BL-NHL", "NB" and "RMS", which correspond to the four groups in
#'          the train dataset}
#'       \item{test.classes:}{\code{\link{factor}} with 5 levels "EWS",
#'          "BL-NHL", "NB", "RMS" and "Norm" which correspond to the five
#'          groups in the test dataset}
#'       \item{annotation:}{\code{\link{data.frame}} of 306 rows and 8 columns.
#'          This table contains further gene annotation retrieved from SOURCE
#'          \url{http://SOURCE.stanford.edu} in May 2004.  For each of the 306 genes,
#'          it contains: \describe{
#'             \item{CloneID}{Image Clone ID}
#'             \item{UGCluster}{The Unigene cluster to which the gene is assigned}
#'             \item{Symbol}{The HUGO gene symbol}
#'             \item{LLID}{The locus ID}

#'             \item{LLRepProtAcc}{Protein sequence accession number}

#' @details
#'
#' Khan et al., 2001 used cDNA microarrays containing 6567 clones of which
#' 3789 were known genes and 2778 were ESTs to study the expression of
#' genes in of four types of small round blue cell tumours of childhood (SRBCT).
#' These were neuroblastoma (NB), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), Burkitt lymphoma, a
#' subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (BL), and the Ewing family of tumours
#' (EWS). Gene expression profiles from both tumour biopsy and cell line
#' samples were obtained and are contained in this dataset. The dataset downloaded
#' from the website contained the filtered dataset of 2308 gene expression profiles as described
#' by Khan et al., 2001.  This dataset was available from the url bioinf.ucd.ie/people/aedin/R/
#' (but the URL has been broken for a while since 2025)
#'
#' In order to reduce the size of the MADE4 package, and produce small example datasets, the top 50 genes from the
#' ends of 3 axes following \code{bga} were selected. This produced a reduced datasets of 306 genes.
